The cdstore application is a very simple wrapper on top of the Chinook
database.

The Chinook data model represents a digital media store, including tables for
artists, albums, media, tracks, invoices and customers.

The cdstore application allows listing useful information and reports on top
of the database and also provides a way to generate some activity.
